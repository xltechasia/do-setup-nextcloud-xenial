# do-setup-nextcloud-xenial
Script to install NextCloud with LAMP on Digital Ocean Xenial Server instance (modified from TechAndMe Repo)

Found the original TechAndMe scripts useful but overly intrusive (e.g. source list manipulations) for a generic / intitial setup with failure/errors (e.g. letsencrypt) at multiple levels.

Working to slim ddown the scripts to work with Digital Ocean Ubuntu 16.04.x environment and hopefully retain the core features & advantages the scripts bring (i.e. NextCloud Add-ons etc)
